# E-Commerce-Shop Project

This E-commerce project was built using React, and the data was fetched and updated from Firestore using React Hooks. A carousel was implemented on the home screen, each product has its own product page (with an opportunity to either favourite an item which updates its status on Firestore, or add it to the cart), and a cart page which lets the user review or remove items in their cart (the cart product data is also stored on Firestore). 

To do: make carousel fetch 'featured' items from Firestore, add total to cart page.
